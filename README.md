# Astrape Core

_A line in the sand. A spark in the storm._

**Astrape Core** is a modular, locally hosted AI orchestration layer designed for flexibility, control, and extensibility. It is the foundation for larger systems — those meant to serve, not surveil.

This repository contains the essential skeleton required to build natural language interfaces with:

- Modular orchestration logic
- Speech-to-text / Text-to-speech integration
- Event recognition and system state management
- Simple tool invocation interface
- Stateless loop with memory-ready scaffolding

### ❗ Status
Pre-alpha. Development is active, but this project is not yet stable.

### 🔍 Philosophy
We believe in software that answers to its user. Astrape Core is built to run on your machines, with your data, under your control.

No cloud. No gatekeepers.

### 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Optional: Docker (setup guide in progress)
- Works best with local LLMs via [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), but backend-agnostic by design.

### 🧪 Current Capabilities
- Voice input loop (modular STT integration)
- Text output via local or cloud TTS
- Wake/sleep/shutdown event parsing
- Simple fallback error handling
- Configurable via YAML
